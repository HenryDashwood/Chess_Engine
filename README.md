My attempt at building a half decent chess engine.

# Phase 1 (Implemented but not yet very well)
Minimax, AB pruning, iterative deepening, hand written heuristic function

# Phase 2 (Not yet done)
Introduce deep learning to determine the heuristic function

# Phase 3 (Not yet done)
Use reinforcement learning to determine the heuristic function
